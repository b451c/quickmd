# Privacy Policy for QuickMD

**Last updated: January 11, 2026**

## Overview

QuickMD is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how QuickMD handles your data and what information (if any) we collect.

## The Short Version

**QuickMD collects ZERO personal data. None. Nada. Nothing.**

We believe your files and data are yours and yours alone. QuickMD is a simple Markdown viewer that runs entirely on your device, offline, with no internet connection required for core functionality.

## Detailed Privacy Information

### Data Collection

**QuickMD does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

Specifically, QuickMD does NOT collect:
- Your name, email, or contact information
- File names or file contents
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Device information
- Location data
- Cookies or tracking data

### File Access

QuickMD only accesses files that **you explicitly open**.

- Files are read locally from your device
- File contents are never transmitted over the internet
- Files are never uploaded to any server
- No files are cached or stored by QuickMD outside of macOS's standard document handling

### Network Access

QuickMD requests **Outgoing Network Connections** permission for the following limited purposes:

1. **Remote Images:** If your Markdown file contains images hosted on the internet (e.g., `![Image](https://example.com/image.png)`), QuickMD will fetch those images to display them. This is done using Apple's native `AsyncImage` API.

2. **Donation Link:** The app contains a "Support QuickMD" button that opens your browser to Buy Me a Coffee (buymeacoffee.com/bsroczynskh). No data is transmitted—this simply opens a web page.

3. **Help Links:** The Help menu contains links to the QuickMD GitHub repository. Clicking these opens your browser; no data is transmitted by QuickMD.

**QuickMD does NOT:**
- Track which images you view
- Log network requests
- Send any data to our servers (we don't have servers!)
- Use analytics services
- Use advertising networks

### Third-Party Services

QuickMD does not use any third-party services, analytics frameworks, or tracking code.

The only external interaction is:
- **Buy Me a Coffee** (optional donation link)—if you click the donation button, you'll be taken to buymeacoffee.com in your browser. Their privacy policy applies once you leave QuickMD.

### App Sandbox

QuickMD runs in **macOS App Sandbox** with the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **User Selected File (Read Only)** | To read Markdown files you explicitly open |
| **Outgoing Network Connections** | To fetch remote images from URLs in your Markdown files |

QuickMD has **NO** access to:
- Your contacts, calendar, or location
- Your camera, microphone, or photos
- Your Downloads, Desktop, or Documents folders (unless you explicitly open a file from there)
- Any system files or settings

### Open Source

QuickMD is **fully open source**. You can review the entire codebase at:

**https://github.com/b451c/quickmd**

See for yourself—there's no analytics, no tracking, no sneaky code. Just a simple Markdown viewer.

### Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this privacy policy (e.g., if we add optional features that require data collection), we will:

1. Update the "Last updated" date at the top
2. Notify users via the GitHub repository
3. Require explicit opt-in for any new data collection

### Data Security

Since QuickMD doesn't collect data, there's no data to secure. Your Markdown files remain on your device and are processed entirely locally.

### Children's Privacy

QuickMD does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we collect zero data, the app is safe for all ages.

### International Users

QuickMD works the same everywhere. We don't collect data from users in any country.

### Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please:

- **Open an issue:** https://github.com/b451c/quickmd/issues
- **Email:** [Contact information will be added when available]

### Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Use QuickMD without providing any personal information (which is exactly how it works)
- Know what data we collect (zero)
- Request deletion of your data (there is no data to delete)
