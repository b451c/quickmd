## Implementation Notes

1. **Keep headlines short** - Max 6 words for impact
2. **Use active voice** - "Read", "Download", "See" not "Can be read"
3. **Avoid jargon** - Not everyone knows "GFM"
4. **Feature benefits > features** - "Easy on the eyes" not "Dark mode support"
5. **CTAs should be action-oriented** - "Download for Free" not "Get Started"
